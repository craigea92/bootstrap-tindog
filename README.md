# BootStrap Tindog

## Project Description
I undertook an engaging project that entailed building a Tinder-inspired app specially crafted for our furry friends! I developed the app using HTML and CSS, which I further augmented with Bootstrap. An immensely useful tool for applying CSS styles to a website.

Bootstrap's documentation proved to be comprehensive, and I encountered only a few minor hiccups while implementing it on my site, which I overcame with ease. 

Having successfully completed this project, I intend to leverage the skills and insights I acquired in future projects, with a view to further refining my development expertise.
